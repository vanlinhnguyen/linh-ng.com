Just finished 10 days off — just me (well, us) and the boys. A new city, a new experience, and a new restaurant every single day. No flights. No stress. Best vacation ever.
Never imagined adventure could be this close to home. And here are a few personal reflections I’m carrying forward:

## Do More With Less

Minimalism isn’t new for us. At home, we’ve practiced it for years: donating what we no longer use, buying less and only to replace or improve, being ruthless about reducing food waste, and simplifying our routines. But this was the first time we consciously applied those principles to a long vacation — no flights, no hotels.

We saved a good bit of money on airfare and accommodations and redirected some of it toward indulging in local foods, moments of rest, and genuine local experiences. What surprised me was how little I missed the “big” vacation. Thinking, Fast and Slow reminds us that our remembered happiness often differs from the moment-to-moment experience. The pleasure of distant, expensive trips can overshadow the quieter, everyday joys right around us.

The same lesson applies at work. In an era of constrained resources and highly competitive markets, the ability to do more with less isn’t a nice-to-have — it’s survival. Lean, high-performing teams that can prioritize ruthlessly while still delivering excellence are the ones that endure. Like Ray Dalio advises in Principles, embracing reality and dealing with it efficiently is a winning formula, whether in business or in life.

## Any Trend Will Eventually End — Be a Lifelong Learner

One of the most striking visits this trip was to a coal mining region in northern France. Decades ago, it was booming. Miners moved in from everywhere for good pay, free housing, quality schools. Even the local football club was strong, and several Olympic athletes came from the community.

And then it all ended. The mines closed, leaving towns like Aniche nearly empty. Today, it’s one of the poorest regions in France, with sky-high unemployment.

The lesson here is clear: whatever job title or career path we hold today, no matter how secure it seems, it won’t last forever. In a world of rapid change, especially with AI and economic uncertainty, staying curious, learning continuously, and investing early in both skills and financial resilience isn’t optional.

It echoes Dalio’s advice: don’t get attached to your current circumstances. Keep evolving. It’s not about making money for its own sake, but about creating the freedom, at some point in life, to choose work that truly matters to you.

Final Thought

Adventure doesn’t have to be expensive or far away. So is happiness and well-being. And security doesn’t come from clinging to the status quo.
Minimalism, adaptability, and curiosity are underrated superpowers — in life, in work, and on vacation.

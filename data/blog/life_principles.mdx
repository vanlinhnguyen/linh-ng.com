# My goal in life
Following the advice of Ray Dalio, I am writing down my life principles. These are rules / foundations that I will not override, even if it means sacrificing something else. Those principles start
with a clear goal, which is:

> __My goal is to be a meaningful member of any community I am part of.__

This means:
- Being a healthy, fullfiled, and kind self
- Being a caring, faitful and responsible husband and father
- Being a proud son and brother
- Being a trustful, honest and reliable friend
- Being an impactful and respected colleague
- Being a kind and helpful neighbor
- Being a patriot of my two countries
- And ultimately, being a good human who contributes meaningfully to biological and social evolution


# My life principles
## 1. Optimise for Contributions to Communities in Nearest Order
Without sacrificing essential responsibilities to others.

#### 1.1. Weighted benefits and consequenses to near-and-far communities

* Consider the impacts on immediate circiles (self, family) before extending to broader community
* Avoid trade the well-being of self or family for work or external validation
* Likewise, avoid selfishly protect immediate interests at the cost of the broader community


## 2. Set reflective milestones that contribute to the goal

#### 2.1. Establish reasonable, archiveble milestones for each period
* Set milestones that meaningfully contribute to final goal (remember Goldilocks Rule)
* Regularly reflect to access alignment, learning and adjustment


## 3. Embrace Truth and Transparency
Radical or not, remember principle 1.

#### 3.1. Actively seek truth through constructive feedbacks and disagreements

* Be explicit about what I want and need - even with family (Radical Candor)
* Speak out, be conversational, and invite open dialogue
* Welcome disagreements and treat as opportunities to uncover truth and learn

#### 3.2. Treat failure and pain as growth opportunities

* Recognize that failure and setbacks are fertile ground for growth
* Pause, refect and write down lessions

# Engineering Manager Toolkit — Linh NG | 2025

## Leadership Principles

_My leadership philosophy for managing in imperfect environments, inspired by Ray Dalio’s “Principles”._


### Prioritize Radical Clarity
- Name problems openly. Say the uncomfortable truths.
- Model vulnerability so others feel safe to do the same.

**Example:**
*"I made a bad call here — here’s what happened and what I’ll change."*

### Align Goals to Unlock Growth
- Understand what motivates each person.
- Help them find pride and purpose in the work.
- Match individual goals / ambitions with team goal. Growth appears when they intersect.
- Align on a common vision, then align on how to get there.

**Example:**
Operational challenge? Give it to someone eager to grow as a lead.

### Constantly Evolve the System
- Turn Mistakes Into Fuel: lightweight, no-blame reflections with the team.
- Spot inefficiencies, tweak processes, and test improvements.
- Never settle for “how it’s always been done.”

**Example:**
Quietly simplify a clunky workflow and share results.

### Lead by Influence, Not Authority
- Earn trust through fairness, clarity, and consistency.
- Focus on what you control: relationships, standards, processes.
- Be on the team, not over it. Defend the team, not yourself.

### Do More With Less
- Embrace constraints as creative opportunities.
- Focus on small, high-leverage actions.

**Example:**
Can’t hire? Simplify, redistribute, or automate.

## 1-on-1 Question Set

**About Them**
- What’s the most interesting thing you’ve worked on here?
- What kind of work makes you feel energized?
- What’s a skill you’d love to build next?
- Who do you admire technically or professionally, and why?

**About the Team**
- What’s one thing you think this team does well?
- What’s one thing you wish was different?
- What’s one thing you feel no one talks about, but should?

**About Working Together**
- How do you prefer to receive feedback — direct, written, casual, scheduled?
- What’s the best way for me to support you right now?
- Is there something you’ve been hesitant to say about your work or the team?

**Reflection**
- What’s a recent mistake you made, and what did you learn from it?
- When have you felt most proud of your work here?
- What’s one thing you think we should stop doing, start doing, or do differently as a team?

**Closing**
- Is there anything you’d like to ask me, or feedback you’d like to give me about how I’m approaching this?

## Team Charter Template

**Purpose:**
A short agreement on how we work together — not a rulebook, but a reflection of how we want to behave.


**Team Name:** *[optional]*
**Date:** *[today]*

### Our Values
- We prioritize clarity over politeness.
- Mistakes are expected — we reflect on them, not hide them.
- Everyone’s ideas and feedback are welcome, no matter your role.

### How We Make Decisions
- Share the problem, options, and reasoning transparently.
- When unclear, the owner decides after input.

### How We Give Feedback
- Fast, honest, and kind.
- Assume good intent.
- Focus on actions, not personalities.

### How We Learn
- Run a short reflection after each project/sprint.
- Share both successes and failures openly.
- Everyone is encouraged to teach others what they learn.

### How We Work Day-to-Day
- Clear ownership for every task.
- Default to over-communicating progress/blockers.
- Support each other — ask for help early.

**Signed (or agreed informally by):** *[names]*

## Post-Mortem / Reflection Guide

**When to use:** After any project, sprint, or major task.

**What was our goal?**
(What were we trying to achieve?)

**What actually happened?**
(Facts, not interpretations.)

**Why did it happen that way?**
(Identify root causes, not symptoms.)

**What did we learn?**
(About ourselves, our processes, our decisions.)

**What will we do differently next time?**
(Concrete actions or adjustments.)

**Is there any tough feedback we need to give or hear right now?**
(Optional but encouraged — reinforce radical truth.)

**How do we track if we actually improved?**
(Set a follow-up or KPI if needed.)

**Pro Tip:**
- Keep it lightweight — 20-30 minutes.
- Rotate facilitator.
- No blame, no long reports.

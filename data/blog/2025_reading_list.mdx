## Atomic Habits
It’s a series of personal observations and experiences buildings habits. James then makes an efforts into explaining the psychological foundation behind how a habit is formalised and maintained over time. Such small changes are proven to give remarkable results through compound effect.

Building a habit should always start with asking yourself: what’s your identify. If your habits are in the oposite direction to the person you want to become, then it’s time to change. Then James come up with 4 laws of Habit: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. The first 3 are all about how to make habits happens in the first place, and the last one is how to make it last. Through out the book, James provides with very powerful yet simple method to stick with a good habit or stop a bad one. The most important I found is about priming your environment. It makes a habit obvious and easy to start. If it helps building and bolding your identify, by itself, it’s attractive and satisfying to see you’re building and reaching it.

The author also points out an extremely important fact, that building a habit, or broader, a career, a life, success is not all about dealing with failure, it's about falling in love with boredom too. With boredom, there it comes with two ways to think about it: either we stick with boredom and find a meaning through suffering, as Viktor has mentioned in his “Man’s search for meaning”, to always stay at the edge of your ability by making it slightly more challenging, according to the Goldilocks rule to find the peak of motivation.

## Thinking, fast and slow
This book has amazed me in many way. Kahneman, as a Nobel Laudrate in psychology and economics, has revealed much of the unknown processes happening in our thinking process. It feels like
the book has helped me to understand myself, providing an alternative ways of thinking about work, life, well-being, and most importantly hapiness.

Through out the books, Kahneman uses the notation of two characters: System 1 (our automatics and effortless thinking) and System 2 (our efforful but lazy thinking), as well as our
two selves, the remembering self and the experiencing self. Through which, Kahneman has loudly pointed out how much we're biased and irational in our thinking and decision. It's way  beyond
a difficult job for me to summarise the list of such biases such as anchoring effects, narrow frameing or xcessive coherence, but all we need to remember is that many of our decisions, without
exargerating, are wrong without us knowing. Our evaluation of our lives overall, including our well-being and happiness, is not an exception and most of the time not reflecting what
we truly feel or want.

Most impressively, after all, Kahneman has shown that those biases all make us human, and there's not much we can do to change. Yet, some suggestions from the author are worth noting when a high-stake decision in life is needed,
or sometime simply some self-reflection to doubt what we see or feel, hence avoiding being influenced by organisations or politicians who use such well-studied weakness to manipulate us. Thsoe suggestions for individuals
could simply to ask ourselves: "Is this number be an anchor...", "Will my decision change if the problem is reframed as...", or "Have I used the base rate to make this prediciton".
For work, some checklists could be enforced such as reference-class forecasting and premortem. In both cases, the core principle one should apply is to think of it more as a gossip: we are better at criticising
someone else instead of self-critisism. As Kahneman mentioned, for most of us, the voices of present gossipers and future critics are clearly more vivid than our own doubts.


My most valuable personal lession from reading this book is probably an alternative view of well-being and hapiness. As we tend to neglect the duration, unfavourable biases toward peaks
and losses compared to gains, I'd need to remind myself that my happy moments are surely much more than suffering ones, and that it's my experiencing self who's living my life, not letting
alone my remembering self to decide how I should feel about my life overall. I'd need to be much more valuing the life I'm having, family and people I'm loving, and be more grateful than I already am.

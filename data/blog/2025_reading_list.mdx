## Atomic Habits
It’s a series of personal observations and experiences buildings habits. James then makes an efforts into explaining the psychological foundation behind how a habit is formalised and maintained over time. Such small changes are proven to give remarkable results through compound effect.

Building a habit should always start with asking yourself: what’s your identify. If your habits are in the oposite direction to the person you want to become, then it’s time to change. Then James come up with 4 laws of Habit: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. The first 3 are all about how to make habits happens in the first place, and the last one is how to make it last. Through out the book, James provides with very powerful yet simple method to stick with a good habit or stop a bad one. The most important I found is about priming your environment. It makes a habit obvious and easy to start. If it helps building and bolding your identify, by itself, it’s attractive and satisfying to see you’re building and reaching it.

The author also points out an extremely important fact, that building a habit, or broader, a career, a life, success is not all about dealing with failure, it's about falling in love with boredom too. With boredom, there it comes with two ways to think about it: either we stick with boredom and find a meaning through suffering, as Viktor has mentioned in his “Man’s search for meaning”, to always stay at the edge of your ability by making it slightly more challenging, according to the Goldilocks rule to find the peak of motivation.

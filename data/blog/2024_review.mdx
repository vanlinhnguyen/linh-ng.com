# 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟒 𝐢𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰

## 1. 𝐅𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐲⁣
 
 (a) We moved back to Lille back in 2023, surprising our friends and family. The whole 2024, there’s not a single day we regretted it⁣
 
 (b) Our two boys had a much healthier year, with Lucas receiving his treatment for the annoying allergy while Felix entered his 2nd year at nursery, hence much more resilient⁣
 
 (c) We all traveled back home to Hanoi, in May. For Lucas and myself, it has been since Covid. It’s a weird feeling. It feels HOME! ⁣
 
 (d) It has been our 13th year Ngoc and I together, and it’s never been enough. Wife, lover, colleague, boss, boys’ mother, whatever it’s called, it’s yet another great 365 days. ⁣
⁣
## 2. 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬⁣
I met some of my best friends in 2024 (Ahmed, Phuong, Sang, Trang, Kannan), while I missed some in the last minutes (Ilkay, Sri, Josip). Best friends are those we might rarely meet / talk to, but it’s always feel connected when together. ⁣
⁣
## 3. 𝐌𝐞⁣
 
 (a) Celebrated 2nd Metaversary - our work anniversary at Meta. It has been a wonderful ride, and everyday worth it. In 2024, I won back my comfort and had a chill year with kids and family.⁣
 
 (b) Continued to invest and hope that FI won’t be far⁣
 
 (c) Started to build my muscle on a new set of skills, both through books and actions, about building things. Interesting reads include but not limited to Zero to One and Lean Startup. Fun time building including reshaping my team at Meta, creating a LLM bot to help Lucas understand his math lesson, and building a Press Release with my co-founder for something we’re passionate about.⁣
 
 (d) “I know I’m on the Right Path Because Things Stopped Being Easy”. (3a) indeed suggests me otherwise, and 2024 gave me a concrete plan for 2025⁣

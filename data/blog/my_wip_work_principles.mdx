# 📖 Work Principles — Linh NG | 2025

_A leadership philosophy for managing in imperfect environments, inspired by Ray Dalio’s “Principles”_

## Prioritize Radical Clarity Over Comfort
- Encourage open, honest conversations.
- Don’t sugarcoat problems — name them.
- Make it safe for people to speak up by modeling vulnerability first.

**Example:**
_"I made a bad call on this process — here's what happened and what I'll do differently."_

## Build Micro-Cultures of Excellence
- Focus on developing a small group of high-potentials first.
- Create norms of craftsmanship, reflection, and feedback within your immediate circle.
- Let quality and curiosity be contagious, not mandated.

**Example:**
Start a voluntary learning circle or sprint reflection ritual.

## Mistakes Are Learning Assets
- Normalize mistakes as opportunities for reflection.
- After every miss, run a lightweight post-mortem.
- Reward honesty about failure, not perfection.

**Example:**
_"Okay — what’s the real reason this went off track? No blame, just learning."_

## Optimize for Influence, Not Authority
- Lead by example, kindness, and consistency — not formal power.
- Earn trust through fairness, clarity, and reliability.
- Focus on what you *can* control: your relationships, your standards, your process.

**Example:**
Build your own island of great work inside a messy system.

## Constantly Evolve the Machine
- Treat the team’s processes and culture like a system you can tinker with.
- Identify weak links, test small improvements, and reflect on outcomes.
- Don’t settle for “that’s how it’s always been done.”

**Example:**
Spot a frustrating workflow? Simplify it, test it quietly, and share results.

## Meaningful Work + Meaningful Relationships = Sustainable Success
- Invest in personal connections with your team.
- Understand what motivates them.
- Help them find purpose and pride in their work, even in a difficult environment.

**Example:**
Spend 1-on-1 time learning what excites and frustrates them.


## Document, Reflect, and Improve Consistently
- Keep a personal log of lessons, decisions, and observations.
- Use it for your own growth and to refine your leadership style.
- Regularly revisit your principles and tweak them as you learn.

**Example:**
End each week jotting down: what worked, what didn’t, what surprised you.


## ✳️ Summary
> **Create radical clarity, foster small pockets of excellence, lead by influence, and use every mistake as fuel to improve the system.**

## Team Charter Template

**Purpose:**
A short agreement on how we work together — not a rulebook, but a reflection of how we want to behave.


**Team Name:** *[optional]*
**Date:** *[today]*

### Our Values
- We prioritize clarity over politeness.
- Mistakes are expected — we reflect on them, not hide them.
- Everyone’s ideas and feedback are welcome, no matter your role.

### How We Make Decisions
- Share the problem, options, and reasoning transparently.
- When unclear, the owner decides after input.

### How We Give Feedback
- Fast, honest, and kind.
- Assume good intent.
- Focus on actions, not personalities.

### How We Learn
- Run a short reflection after each project/sprint.
- Share both successes and failures openly.
- Everyone is encouraged to teach others what they learn.

### How We Work Day-to-Day
- Clear ownership for every task.
- Default to over-communicating progress/blockers.
- Support each other — ask for help early.

**Signed (or agreed informally by):** *[names]*

## Post-Mortem / Reflection Guide

**When to use:** After any project, sprint, or major task.

**What was our goal?**
(What were we trying to achieve?)

**What actually happened?**
(Facts, not interpretations.)

**Why did it happen that way?**
(Identify root causes, not symptoms.)

**What did we learn?**
(About ourselves, our processes, our decisions.)

**What will we do differently next time?**
(Concrete actions or adjustments.)

**Is there any tough feedback we need to give or hear right now?**
(Optional but encouraged — reinforce radical truth.)

**How do we track if we actually improved?**
(Set a follow-up or KPI if needed.)

**Pro Tip:**
- Keep it lightweight — 20-30 minutes.
- Rotate facilitator.
- No blame, no long reports.

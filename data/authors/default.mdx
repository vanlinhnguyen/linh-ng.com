I’m a Software Engineer in Machine Learning with 10+ years of experience across diverse fields. I also hold a PhD and am an inventor, mentor, tech lead, and passionate advocate for both personal and professional growth. Beyond work, I’m a proud father, husband, friend, and colleague.

For the past three years, I’ve been at Meta, working in the Ads targeting space, where we help bridge the gap between businesses and customers through a $20B/year product. Before Meta, I spent two years working on computer vision for video surveillance and five years in machine learning and data analytics in the travel industry.

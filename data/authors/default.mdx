I’m a Software Engineer in Machine Learning with 10+ years of experience across diverse fields. I also hold a PhD and am an inventor, mentor, tech lead, and passionate advocate for both personal and professional growth. Beyond work, I’m a proud father, husband, friend, and colleague.

Currently at Meta, I've been working in the Ads targeting space, where we help bridge the gap between businesses and customers through a $20B/year product. Before Meta, I worked on computer vision for video surveillance and machine learning / data analytics in the travel industry.

I'm experienced Software Engineer in Machine Learning with 10+ years in the industry and research: ads, e-commerce, computer vision, search/shopping, and physics.

At Meta, I work in Ads targeting space, where we help to build the bridge between businesses and customers through a 20B$ / year product.

Before Meta, I worked at Digital Barriers, a Video Surveillance company where I put Deep Neural Network at the heart of our video analytic products, which aims at replacing existing solutions while scalable in tiny edge devices.

I also spent 5 years at Amadeus, where I applied Machine learning to different Airline IT, Search and Shopping products.
